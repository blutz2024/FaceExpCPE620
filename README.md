# FaceExpCPE620 ðŸš€

## Introduction

In this term project for CpE 620 - Deep Learning, we attempt to perform Few-Shot Domain Adaptation for Face Expression Recognition

## Methods

### Datasets
- FER-2013 dataset. Find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013). It has 35.9k 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. Training Set: 28821, Testing Set: 7066. 

- Manga Facial Expressions. Find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mertkkl/manga-facial-expressions). Dataset consists of mangas (Japanese comics) faces of facial expressions. There are 454 images there

In the codebase, you need to download these datasets and put them into folders named `fer2013` and `manga`.
